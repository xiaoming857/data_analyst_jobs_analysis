## Introduction and Hypothesis

Job is required to fill in the necessities. The pandemic has caused a bad impact on numerous of jobs, this is caused by the lock-downs, work from home, or any other policies to keep the pandemic under control. Truth to be told, there are jobs that still persisted and even play important role during the pandemic. One of such job is the data analyst. "A data analyst collects, cleans, and interprets data sets in order to answer a question of solve a problem." (Coursera, 2021).

Organizations or big industries around the world depend on data analyst to make critical decisions. During the pandemic, the data analysts are highly needed by governmental agencies or health agencies to analyze the Corona virus mutation and spread in order to take preventive measures. Big industries and businesses also need data analyst to predict the market demand. According to a research summary, there are 87,627 employed data analysts in the United States (Zippia, 2021). 

For this reason, the confidence of being a data analyst is also risen. This may leads data analysts around the world to be more picky about their job offer, such as better working environment or higher salary.

The purpose of this project is to predict the company salary based on factors such as company rating, location, size, age, type of ownership, industry, sector, and revenue. This analysis gives data analysts an overview as an additional resource for consideration.
